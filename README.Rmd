## Overview

melt provides a unified framework for data analysis with empirical likelihood methods.
A collection of functions are available to perform multiple empirical likelihood tests and construct confidence intervals for various models in 'R'.
It offers an easy-to-use interface and flexibility in specifying hypotheses and calibration methods, extending the framework to simultaneous inferences.
The core computational routines are implemented with the 'Eigen' 'C++' library and 'RcppEigen' interface, with 'OpenMP' for parallel computation. 
Details of the testing procedures are given in [Kim, MacEachern, and Peruggia (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1080/10485252.2023.2206919). 
This work was supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation under Grants No. [SES-1921523](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1921523) and [DMS-2015552](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2015552).


## Installation

You can install the latest stable release of melt from CRAN.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("melt")
```

You can install the development version of melt from GitHub or [R-universe](http://ropensci.r-universe.dev/ui/#package:melt).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("ropensci/melt")
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("melt", repos = "https://ropensci.r-universe.dev")
```


## Main functions

melt provides an intuitive API for performing the most common data analysis tasks:

* `el_mean()` computes empirical likelihood for the mean.
* `el_lm()` fits a linear model with empirical likelihood.
* `el_glm()` fits a generalized linear model with empirical likelihood.
* `confint()` computes confidence intervals for model parameters.
* `confreg()` computes confidence region for model parameters.
* `elt()` tests a linear hypothesis.
* `elmt()` performs multiple testing simultaneously.


## Usage
```{r usage, eval = TRUE}
library(melt)
set.seed(971112)

## Test for the mean
data("precip")
el_mean(precip, par = 30)


## Linear model
data("mtcars")
fit_lm <- el_lm(mpg ~ disp + hp + wt + qsec, data = mtcars)
summary(fit_lm)
cr <- confreg(fit_lm, parm = c("disp", "hp"), npoints = 200)
plot(cr)
data("clothianidin")
fit2_lm <- el_lm(clo ~ -1 + trt, data = clothianidin)
summary(fit2_lm)
confint(fit2_lm)


## Generalized linear model
data("thiamethoxam")
fit_glm <- el_glm(visit ~ log(mass) + fruit + foliage + var + trt,
  family = quasipoisson(link = "log"), data = thiamethoxam,
  control = el_control(maxit = 100, tol = 1e-08, nthreads = 4)
)
summary(fit_glm)


## Test of no treatment effect
contrast <- c(
  "trtNaked - trtFungicide", "trtFungicide - trtLow", "trtLow - trtHigh"
)
elt(fit2_lm, lhs = contrast)


## Multiple testing
contrast2 <- rbind(
  c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0),
  c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0),
  c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1)
)
elmt(fit_glm, lhs = contrast2)
```
