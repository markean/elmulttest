Description: Performs multiple empirical likelihood tests. It offers an
    easy-to-use interface and flexibility in specifying hypotheses and
    calibration methods, extending the framework to simultaneous
    inferences.  The core computational routines are implemented using the
    'Eigen' 'C++' library and 'RcppEigen' interface, with 'OpenMP' for
    parallel computation.  Details of the testing procedures are provided
    in Kim, MacEachern, and Peruggia (2023)
    <doi:10.1080/10485252.2023.2206919>. A companion paper by Kim,
    MacEachern, and Peruggia (2024) <doi:10.18637/jss.v108.i05> is
    available for further information. This work was supported by the U.S.
