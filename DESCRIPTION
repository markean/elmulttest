Title: Multiple Empirical Likelihood Tests
Version: 1.5.1.9000
Description: Performs multiple empirical likelihood tests for linear and generalized linear models. 
    The core computational routines are implemented using the 'Eigen' C++ library and 'RcppEigen' 
    interface, with OpenMP for parallel computation. Details of multiple testing procedures are 
    given in Kim et al. (2021) <arxiv:2112.09206>.
