Description: Performs multiple empirical likelihood tests for linear and
    generalized linear models. The package offers an easy-to-use interface
    and flexibility in specifying hypotheses and calibration methods,
    extending the framework to simultaneous inferences. The core
    computational routines are implemented using the 'Eigen' C++ library
    and 'RcppEigen' interface, with OpenMP for parallel computation.
    Details of the testing procedures are given in Kim, MacEachern, and
    Peruggia (2021) <arxiv:2112.09206>. This work was supported by the
    U.S. National Science Foundation under Grants No. SES-1921523 and
