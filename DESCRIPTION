Title: Multiple Empirical Likelihood Tests
Version: 1.3.0.9000
Description: Performs multiple empirical likelihood tests for regression analysis. 
    Much of its functionality and syntax mimics the corresponding base R functions. 
    The core computational routines are implemented using the 'Eigen' C++ library 
    and 'RcppEigen' interface, with OpenMP for parallel computation. Additional 
    functions are available for multiple testing for the analysis of experimental 
    designs. Details of the testing procedures are given in Kim et al. (2021) 
    <arxiv:2112.09206>.
